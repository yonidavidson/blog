I write code at night and work at day (writing more code).
Lately my passions are React(Web and native) and Deep learning.
I am working as a Full stack engineer and on my thesis (Classification of radio modulations using deep learning) in the rest of the time.

I have a strong background in IOT (C, C++), Cloud and Automation, I worked with server-less architecture and my favorite languages are Go and JavaScript.

I am a TDD advocate and I use it through all my work.
